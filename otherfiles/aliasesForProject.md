# Server Aliases for Project 

## Local Aliases(konrads local machine)
go378server - changes directory to my keys folder then ssh into 378 server

## Remote Aliases(pi)
startserver - enters server directory and starts server

- current open http requests
 - http://ssh.378lab.cool:11023/

## Next Steps For Project
- make executables for other os(i have wind and linux so far)
- record video of it working
- explain code in readme and transfer to report/slides
- probably also need to communicate with the professor that we only have 3 people working on the project...
 - maybe we can shorten our presentation time or report length.
- im going to record myself running the project but not explaining it in the video 
- ill explain it however long i need to: explanations will be in person during the presentations.
- i will put the video somewhere in our slides
